I am an Assistant Professor in [Data Science, Analytics, and Visualization](https://chaminade.edu/nsm/data-science/){target="_blank"} at [Chaminade University of Honolulu](https://chaminade.edu){target="blank_"}. I specialize in research methods, experimental design, and analysis.

My background is in linguistics. While I enjoy all areas of linguistics, my primary interests lie in laboratory phonology, phonetics, psycholinguistics, and first and second language acquisition. I am particularly interested in how we use suprasegmental or prosodic cues in real-time word and sentence processing.
