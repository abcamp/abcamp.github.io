## What do you want to do in class on Friday?

On a post-it note, write what you want to do in class on Friday. Some options include:

1.  Open-ended work time (on websites)

2.  Specific website-y topics like resumes, etc.

Names are not required!

Leave the post-it by the microwave on your way out.

## Optional

If you need help, you can indicate on the post-it and I'll email you :)\
(Do write your name, in this case)
