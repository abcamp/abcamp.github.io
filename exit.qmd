## What do you want to do in class on Monday?

Write a '1' or a '2' on the post-it and stick it on the wall next to the door on your way out. No names required.

1.  Spend one more day on websites\
    (maybe discuss personal branding & professionalism?)

2.  Move on to the next unit (tidycensus!)

## Optional

If you need help, you can indicate on the post-it and I'll email you :)\
(Do write your name, in this case)
