I work closely with students on community-engaged, applied, and interdisciplinary research in data science. My advising emphasizes ethical reasoning and technical skill-building.

## Current Advisees

-   **Johnny Bae**
-   **Wilneris Carrion-Colon**
-   **Lela Gi**

-   **Lydia Hefel & Logan Lasell** – *Spring 2024*
    -   Extracting and processing vowel data using Montreal Forced Aligner, Python, and Praat
    -   Contributing to the LanguageFinder project

## Group & Program Mentoring

    *Texas Advanced Computing Center, Summer 2025 (co-located with PEARC25)*\
    Mentored an undergraduate team on a week-long data science challenge involving high-performance computing, civic data, and exploratory and predictive modeling

## How to Work With Me

Many advising collaborations begin through coursework, especially in DS-495 (Directed Research). I'm especially enthusiastic about working with students who are curious, analytic, and committed to grounding their work in both rigorous data methods and strong theoretical frameworks.

While I support interdisciplinary work broadly, I have a particular affinity for projects rooted in the social sciences and linguistics, and I’m especially excited about community-engaged approaches.
