title: "Recommendation Letters"

I'm happy to write letters of recommendation for students applying to internships, jobs, scholarships, graduate programs, and anything else! I spend about 1-3 hours crafting each letter to support your success, and it's one of my favorite parts of mentoring.

To help me write you the strongest possible letter, here's what I need from you:

### 1. Give me at least 2 weeks notice

The earlier you ask, the better! My schedule fills up weeks in advance, and I want to make sure I have time to give each letter the care and thought it deserves.

*Rush requests:* I can occasionally accommodate these, especially if I've written a letter for you before. Please understand that I may not always be able to meet last-minute deadlines.

*Multiple deadlines:* If you're applying to several programs, the 2-week window applies to your earliest deadline. I'm happy to submit multiple letters, though I may not be able to heavily customize each one.

### 2. Understand what makes a strong letter

The strongest letters include specific examples of your skills, work ethic, and potential. I can write strong letters for students who:

-   Earned an **A** in my class
-   Work or have worked directly with me (as an advisee, research assistant, etc.)
-   Are currently in my course(s) and performing well, with regular attendance

If your situation is different and you believe I'm your best option, **please reach out anyway**! Let's have a conversation about:

-   What I can honestly speak to about your abilities
-   Whether the letter I can write will serve you well
-   Whether there might be other options you haven't considered (supervisors from jobs/internships, community leaders, etc.)

I want to help, and sometimes a good letter from someone who knows you in a limited context is better than no letter at all. Let's figure out what will best support your goals.

### 3. Help me write specifics

The best letters include concrete examples. To help me include these, please email me at [amber.camp\@chaminade.edu](mailto:amber.camp@chaminade.edu) with:

-   **The basics:** Deadline, program/position name, and a current resume or CV
-   **Why this opportunity?** What draws you to this program or position?
-   **Why me?** What about my class or our work together connects to what you're applying for?
-   **What stood out?** Remind me of your best work, projects, or moments in class. I teach many students and want to highlight your strengths accurately!

### 4. Let me know how it goes!

Writing letters of recommendation is one of the most rewarding ways I can support you, so I would love an update. Please let me know how it goes, whether you got it or are trying again. I'd love to celebrate with you or offer encouragement for next steps.
