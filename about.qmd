This could be my about page, but it's a placeholder for now.

Here is an example of an embedded video (there is no sound in this video, but if there was, that should work!)

![](media/movie.mp4){fig-align="center" width="40%"}

FYI, I tried a .mov file and it didn't work. This one is an .mp4

Here it is again, but left-aligned and a little larger--just so you know these customizations are possible.

![](media/movie.mp4){fig-align="left" width="50%"}
