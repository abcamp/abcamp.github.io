    "text": "Current projects\n\nThai tone & intonation\nMy dissertation includes five experiments designed to investigate the interaction of lexical tone and sentential intonation in Thai in both perception and production. Specifically, I am investigating how the effects of sentence-final boundary tones (L% or H%) manifest in the phonetic realization of lexical tone, and how the resulting variability of tonal realization is processed. The results of these experiments bear on questions such as whether tonal representations include exemplars of intonationally-induced tonal variability or if cues to lexical tone are processed separately from intonation. Sample materials from Experiment 1 are available here.\n\n\nStress in Pidgin (Hawaiʻi Creole)\nHawaiʻi Creole, known as Pidgin locally in Hawaiʻi, is English-lexified but exhibits unique prosodic patterns unlike those found in English. For example, yes/no questions have a final falling contour, rather than a final rise, and Pidgin is syllable-time rather than stress-timed. This project is aimed at investigating the acoustic correlates of word-level stress in Pidgin, using perceptual information, as a first step toward the complete description of Pidgin intonation. This research is being conducted under the guidance of Victoria B. Anderson and Rory Turnbull.\n\n\nStructural probabilities in speech production in Japanese\nThis study is a collaboration with Nozomi Tanaka, and is based on previous work by Chigusa Kurumada. The predictability of words is known to influence acoustic output, in which more predictable words are produced with a shorter duration. This study explores whether structural probability is also reflected in incremental speech production. We used Japanese relative clauses to address this question, as these relative clauses are prenominal, and the embedded subject can be marked with the ambiguous nominative marker –ga or the genitive marker –no; the nominative marker is also used in independent clauses, but the genitive marker is not, increasing the probability of an upcoming head noun. This work has recently been presented at ICPhS 2019, and additional data collection is ongoing. Read the proceedings.\n\n\nNasality in Lakota\nThis study is a collaboration with Ryan E. Henke. The aim of this study is to test the effect of orthography in teaching the nasal vowel contrast in Lakota to naive L2 learners. The experiment includes a simple discrimination task as a pre-test to determine whether English monolinguals can perceive the nasal contrast without explicit instruction, followed by a training module, and a post-test to measure improvement from the pre-test. A primary goal of this research is to apply the results from this study toward pedagogical methods for the revitalization of understudied, underdocumented, and endangered languages. This work has recently been presented at ICLDC 2019, and additional analyses are underway. \n\n\nLanguageFinder\nThis project is in collaboration with Catherine Brockway and Connor Flynn. Stay tuned for more!"

    "text": "Linguistics 420: Morphology (Spring 2021)\n\nUniversity of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa\nIn Ling 420 we discuss various morphological phenomena and approaches to morphological issues, using examples from many languages. This course is designed to provide students with necessary knowledge and skills of morphological analysis, introduce morphological terms and major morphological phenomena, and demonstrate how morphology interacts with syntax and phonology. The class engages in morphological analysis regularly.\nBy the end of the course, students will be able to:\n\ndefine and discuss core notions related to morphology\nrecognize and understand examples illustrating major morphological phenomena\nexamine and compare morphological phenomena from a typological stance\nconduct and present morphological analyses of linguistic data\n\nFamiliarity with basic linguistics, including basic syntactic and phonological terminology, is assumed. The prerequisite for this course is Ling 320 (General Linguistics), but Ling 421 (Introduction to Phonological Analysis) and Ling 422 (Introduction to Grammatical Analysis) are recommended. Students who take Ling 420 are typically early graduate students or advanced undergraduates.\nSample Ling 420 syllabus (Spring 2021)\n\n\n\n\nLinguistics 102: Introduction to the study of language\n\nUniversity of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa\nLing 102 is a 3-credit, 100-level non-technical introduction to linguistics, the scientific study of language. We talk about what makes language language and how students can begin to describe and analyze the languages and dialects spoken and heard around them. Major goals of this course include fostering an appreciation for linguistic and cultural diversity, and encouraging critical thinking through making connections between real-world observations, life experiences, and classroom knowledge. The course includes a Writing-Intensive focus, and includes projects and assignments designed to help students develop tools to use in future classes and employment: researching, writing, editing, working in groups, and clearly communicating ideas.\nSome of the things students learn to do in this class include:\n\nlearning to broadly transcribe American English words using the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)\nanalyzing sentences in multiple languages in terms of grammatical relations and thematic roles\nreconstructing sounds and words in a proto-language, and\npresenting informed arguments about real-world events and attitudes related to linguistics and language\n\nSample Ling 102 syllabus (Fall 2019)"
