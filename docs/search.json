I spend about 1-3 hours crafting each letter to support your success, and it’s one of my favorite parts of mentoring.\nTo help me write you the strongest possible letter, here’s what I need from you:\n\n1. Give me at least 2 weeks notice\nThe earlier you ask, the better! My schedule fills up weeks in advance, and I want to make sure I have time to give each letter the care and thought it deserves.\nRush requests: I can occasionally accommodate these, especially if I’ve written a letter for you before. Please understand that I may not always be able to meet last-minute deadlines.\nMultiple deadlines: If you’re applying to several programs, the 2-week window applies to your earliest deadline. I’m happy to submit multiple letters, though I may not be able to heavily customize each one.\n\n\n2. Understanding what makes a strong letter\nThe strongest letters include specific examples of your skills, work ethic, and potential. I can write strong letters for students who:\n\nEarned an A in my class\nWork or have worked directly with me (as an advisee, research assistant, etc.)\nAre currently in my course(s) and performing well, with regular attendance\n\nIf your situation is different and you believe I’m your best option, please reach out anyway! Let’s have a conversation about:\n\nWhat I can honestly speak to about your abilities\nWhether the letter I can write will serve you well\nWhether there might be other options you haven’t considered (supervisors from jobs/internships, community leaders, etc.)\n\nI want to help, and sometimes a good letter from someone who knows you in a limited context is better than no letter at all. Let’s figure out what will best support your goals.\n\n\n3. Help me write specifics\nThe best letters include concrete examples. To help me include these, please email me at amber.camp@chaminade.edu with:\n\nThe basics: Deadline, program/position name, and a current resume or CV\nWhy this opportunity? What draws you to this program or position?\nWhy me? What about my class or our work together connects to what you’re applying for?\nWhat stood out? Remind me of your best work, projects, or moments in class. I teach many students and want to highlight your strengths accurately!\n\n\n\n4. Let me know how it goes!\nWriting letters of recommendation is one of the most rewarding ways I can support you, so I would love an update. Please let me know how it goes, whether you got it or are trying again. I’d love to celebrate with you or offer encouragement for next steps."

    "text": "Current projects\n\nThai tone & intonation\nMy dissertation includes five experiments designed to investigate the interaction of lexical tone and sentential intonation in Thai in both perception and production. Specifically, I am investigating how the effects of sentence-final boundary tones (L% or H%) manifest in the phonetic realization of lexical tone, and how the resulting variability of tonal realization is processed. The results of these experiments bear on questions such as whether tonal representations include exemplars of intonationally-induced tonal variability or if cues to lexical tone are processed separately from intonation.\n\n\nStress in Pidgin (Hawaiʻi Creole)\nHawaiʻi Creole, known as Pidgin locally in Hawaiʻi, is English-lexified but exhibits unique prosodic patterns unlike those found in English. For example, yes/no questions have a final falling contour, rather than a final rise, and Pidgin is syllable-time rather than stress-timed. This project is aimed at investigating the acoustic correlates of word-level stress in Pidgin, using perceptual information, as a first step toward the complete description of Pidgin intonation. This research is being conducted under the guidance of Victoria B. Anderson and Rory Turnbull.\n\n\nStructural probabilities in speech production in Japanese\nThis study is a collaboration with Nozomi Tanaka, and is based on previous work by Chigusa Kurumada. The predictability of words is known to influence acoustic output, in which more predictable words are produced with a shorter duration. This study explores whether structural probability is also reflected in incremental speech production. We used Japanese relative clauses to address this question, as these relative clauses are prenominal, and the embedded subject can be marked with the ambiguous nominative marker –ga or the genitive marker –no; the nominative marker is also used in independent clauses, but the genitive marker is not, increasing the probability of an upcoming head noun. This work has recently been presented at ICPhS 2019, and additional data collection is ongoing. Read the proceedings.\n\n\nNasality in Lakota\nThis study is a collaboration with Ryan E. Henke. The aim of this study is to test the effect of orthography in teaching the nasal vowel contrast in Lakota to naive L2 learners. The experiment includes a simple discrimination task as a pre-test to determine whether English monolinguals can perceive the nasal contrast without explicit instruction, followed by a training module, and a post-test to measure improvement from the pre-test. A primary goal of this research is to apply the results from this study toward pedagogical methods for the revitalization of understudied, underdocumented, and endangered languages. This work has recently been presented at ICLDC 2019, and additional analyses are underway.\n\n\nLanguageFinder\nThis project is in collaboration with Catherine Brockway and Connor Flynn. A current working demo is available here.\nStay tuned for more!"
